      "A multi-threaded C program that analyzes police response times, utilizing mutex locks to protect critical sections during statistical calculations on 500K+ records.",
    longDescription:
      "This assignment required writing a C program to analyze police data, implementing multi-threaded processing of fixed-length records. The program processes a header file that specifies field sizes, reads data records, and then performs statistical analysis of police response times across different categories and districts. I designed and implemented a multi-threaded C program that analyzes police response times, utilizing mutex locks to protect critical sections during statistical calculations on 500K+ records. I engineered a data processing system with batch reading that effectively distributed workload across threads, reducing memory usage while maintaining thread safety through synchronization. Additionally, I developed statistical analysis functionality calculating min/max, quartiles, and standard deviation across police districts, implementing outlier detection using IQR methodology for accurate response time analysis.",

I enhanced an open-source vehicle simulator by upgrading its resolution to 4K (3840x2160) and refining vehicle dynamics for greater realism. The simulation features realistic physics simulations, accurate sensor models (including LIDAR, radar, and cameras), and various environmental conditions to test vehicle behavior. I integrated NEAT algorithm improvements for enhanced neural network efficiency in real-time decision-making.
